        <h2>The Flood!</h2>
        <p class="text_box">
          Stories have it that 25,000 years ago The Leviathan made the sky cry
          and it weeped for a millennia causing the planet to flood. This godly
          being also brought an army of unworldy creatures. After that nothing
          has been the same. We now really only refer to time as BF (Before
          Flood) or AF (After Flood). Currency after the flood is only two main
          components, bullets and drinkable water. People have started to make
          boat homes and connect them with other boat homes essentially making a
          floating city. There are still bits of lands left. We got islands
          popping up and disappearing on the daily. Small civilizations have
          been populating these bits of lands, but that's usually only the
          wealthy.

        <h2>World landscape (or whats left...)</h2>
        <p class="text_box">
          The world is mostly water with islands scattered around. Some trees
          have adapted to grow in and break the oceans surface. <br />
          Some civilizations (mostly made of Ape folk) live in these giant
          trees.

        <h2>Setting</h2>
        <p class="text_box">
          This is a post apocalyptic world that is based off of the pirate era,
          steampunk and a mix of modern day world. It also has some cosmic
          horror/lovecraftian influence.<br />
          There also a fantasy influence so theres magic.
        </p>

      <div>
        <h2>Currency</h2>
        <p class="text_box">
          100 bullets = 1 gallon of water <br />
          For reference a row boat cost about 50 gallons of water.
        </p>

      <div>
        <h2>The Leviathan</h2>
        <p class="text_box">
          The Leviathan is a godly being that has flooded and plauged this world
          with its spawn. <br />
          The main Leviathan is a legendary creature that is extremely rare to
          encouter and will wipe out almost any party. How ever its offspring is
          a different story.<br />
          Many brave adventures have taken on the likes of these monsters and
          lived to tell the tale.
